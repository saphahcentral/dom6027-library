    <h2 style="color:wheat;">Alterations of Derech Olam: From Tree of Life to Tree of Death</h2>

    <p>
      From the beginning, humanity was given a choice between two trees:
      the <strong>Tree of Life</strong>, representing obedience and eternal fellowship
      with YHVH, and the <strong>Tree of Death</strong>, representing rebellion
      and corruption. The path of Derech Olam (Way of the World/Way of Eternity)
      has been altered repeatedly as men chose deception over truth.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">The First Alteration – Eden</h3>
    <p>
      In Beresith 3, the serpent’s lie replaced YHVH’s pure Word with a mixture of
      truth and deceit. This was the first alteration—substituting the eternal way
      with a counterfeit. Humanity’s fall was not only disobedience but an
      <em>altered word</em>, shaping religion with compromise.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">The Alterations Continue</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Babel</strong> – A false unity built on rebellion, birthing man-made worship systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Egypt</strong> – A counterfeit of power and idolatry that enslaved YHVH’s people.</li>
      <li><strong>Exile in Babylon</strong> – The blending of Torah with pagan calendars, names, and traditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Rabbinic Judaism</strong> – Adding fences around Torah until the command became obscured.</li>
      <li><strong>Constantinian Christianity</strong> – Replacing Sabbath and Mo’edim with Sunday and Roman festivals.</li>
      <li><strong>Modern Religion</strong> – Division, denominations, and watered-down messages that obscure covenant truth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">The Humbling Thread</h3>
    <p>
      Despite these alterations, YHVH’s covenant thread remained unbroken. From
      Noach to Avraham, from Mosheh to the Prophets, from Yahusha to His talmidim,
      the Tree of Life was never removed—it was preserved as a remnant for the
      humble and obedient.
    </p>

    <blockquote style="color:lightgreen; border-left:2px solid wheat; padding-left:10px;">
      “See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil… therefore choose life,
      that you and your offspring may live.” (Devarim / Deuteronomy 30:15–19)
    </blockquote>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">Our Call Today</h3>
    <p>
      Derech Olam Ministries acknowledges these historical alterations not as a curse,
      but as a humbling effect on each generation. We are called back to the Tree of Life,
      walking in Torah and Messiah Yahusha without compromise. Each distortion of truth
      reminds us of our duty to test every spirit, return to the Mo’edim, and honor YHVH’s
      original covenant design.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Alterations of Derech Olam warn us against the religion of men. The Way of YHVH is
      eternal, unchanged from Beresith to Revelation. To walk in it is to embrace covenant
      truth, align with Yahusha, and prepare as a bride for His coming reign.
