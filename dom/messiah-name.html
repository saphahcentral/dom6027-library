    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This resource explains the historical transmission of the Messiah’s Name, why Derech Olam prefers the Hebraic renderings <strong>Yahusha</strong> (for the Messiah) and <strong>Yahuah</strong> (for the Divine Name, abbreviated <strong>YHVH</strong>), and how translations from Hebrew → Greek → Latin → English produced later forms such as “Jesus.” Our aim is restoration and clarity in worship and teaching.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Historical Transmission of the Name</h3>
      <p>When Hebrew names move between alphabets and languages, their shapes and sounds change. Translators used local letters and phonetic approximations; vowels were supplied according to the receiving language. Over centuries the original Hebraic theophoric elements have been obscured in Western forms. Understanding that chain helps us recover the Name in a way faithful to the original covenant language.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Hebrew Forms: Yehoshua, Yeshua, Yahusha</h3>
      <p>The Hebrew root behind the Name is tied to the verb for saving (יָשַׁע - yashah) with the divine element of the Name. The principal forms are:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Yehoshua (יְהוֹשֻׁעַ)</strong> — the fuller theophoric form (rendered as “Yehoshua” / Joshua). It contains the divine element YH- and the saving root.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> - historical onomastics</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Yeshua (יֵשׁוּעַ)</strong> — a contracted, common Second-Temple period Hebrew form used widely among Hebrew and Aramaic speakers.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> - Second-Temple evidence</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Yahusha / Yahushua</strong> — a transliteration that preserves the divine syllable <em>Yah</em> more explicitly alongside the saving root. This form is preferred in Derech Olam because it keeps the theophoric element prominent and clearly ties the Name to <strong>Yahuah</strong> (the Divine Name).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> - transliteration rationale</p>

      <p>All forms underline the same meaning: <em>YHWH saves</em>. The Name itself proclaims the saving work of the Messiah.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>How Greek and Latin Rendered the Name</h3>
      <p>Greek translators rendered Hebrew names using Greek letters and phonology. The Hebrew Yeshua appears in Greek manuscripts as <em>Ἰησοῦς</em> (Iēsous). Latin then recorded the Greek form (IESVS), and later orthographic developments in Western languages produced the modern English shape and pronunciation. Each stage reflects alphabetic constraints and language evolution rather than the original Hebrew consonantal meaning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Why “Jesus” Is Not the Hebraic Name</h3>
      <p>The English form “Jesus” is the endpoint of a chain of transmission: Hebrew → Greek → Latin → Old English → Modern English. During that chain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Greek letters represented Hebrew consonants and added Greek vowel patterns.</li>
        <li>Latin preserved the Greek form; later, the letter J developed in Western orthographies and pronunciation changed.</li>
        <li>The modern English pronunciation therefore departs from the original Hebrew consonantal structure and obscures the theophoric syllable that ties the Name to YHVH.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For covenantal restoration we therefore prefer forms that retain the Hebraic theophoric element.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>Theological and Practical Importance</h3>
      <p>Names in Scripture carry theological weight. Restoring the Hebraic Name is not simply a linguistic preference; it helps the community recover the theological content embedded in the Name — that the Messiah’s Name itself proclaims the saving work of YHVH. Using Hebraic renderings in liturgy and teaching restores covenant speech and deepens awareness of the Name’s meaning.</p>

      <h3>How We Render the Name in Derech Olam</h3>
      <p>In teaching and liturgy we prefer a Hebraic transliteration that preserves the divine syllable. Our common choices are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yahusha</strong> — emphasizes the divine syllable “Yah” and the saving root.</li>
        <li><strong>Yeshua</strong> — recognized Second-Temple Hebrew form.</li>
        <li><strong>Yehoshua</strong> — fuller theophoric form (e.g., Joshua).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When addressing mixed audiences we may include the familiar English rendering in parentheses for clarity (e.g., Yahusha <em>(Yeshua / Jesus)</em>), while keeping the Hebraic form as the primary liturgical usage.</p>

      <h3>Scriptural References</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Yeshua: for he shall save his people from their sins.”</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p> - Acts 4:12 - </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>“Hear, O Israel: YHVH our Elohim, YHVH is One. And you shall love YHVH your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.”</p>

      <h3>Usage Guidelines for Teachers and Congregations</h3>
      <p>Recommended practice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Hebraic form in liturgy and teaching while including the common English form in parentheses for clarity with mixed audiences.</li>
        <li>Provide a short footnote or a link to this resource explaining transliteration choices when publishing materials for the general public.</li>
        <li>Be pastoral: explain that this preference honours the original language and meaning and is not meant to condemn those raised with other forms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Further Reading & Resources</h3>
      <p>For deeper study consult Hebrew lexicons, onomastic studies of Second-Temple names, and Greek-Latin textual studies. The YAH Scriptures PDF in our resource library provides alternate verse renderings that may be useful for classroom comparisons.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Restoring the Hebraic Name of the Messiah — using <strong>Yahusha</strong> in worship and the Divine Name <strong>Yahuah (YHVH)</strong> where appropriate — helps the community worship with covenantal language and clarity. This resource seeks to equip teachers and leaders with a simple, pastoral approach to restoring the sacred identity of the Name while remaining gracious to those from different traditions.</p>
