        <h1>“Amen”: Origins, Warnings, and Liturgical Correction</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Thesis and Purpose</h2>
        <p>This article presents an alternative reading to recent popular scholarship: the liturgical use of the word <em>"Amen"</em> as a standard prayer-ending in many religious traditions is not a neutral Semitic affirmation but rather a vestige of cultural and religious syncretism with the Egyptian deity <em>Amun / Ammon-Ra</em>. For communities seeking to restore pure worship of YHVH and to avoid idolatrous or demonic associations, we recommend avoiding <em>amen</em> as a ritual closer and instead conclude prayers with the Hebraic doxology <strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Historical and Cultural Background</h2>
        <p>The name <em>Amun</em> (also spelled <em>Amon</em>, <em>Ammon</em>) was central to Egyptian religion and, when syncretized with Ra, became the widely venerated <em>Amun-Ra</em>. Through trade, conquest, and cultural exchange, theophoric names and ritual formulas from Egypt and other neighboring cultures spread across the Levant. Some ancient Near Eastern practices were adopted or adapted by nearby peoples, producing layered liturgical practices.</p>

        <p>Where the phonetic form <em>amen</em> appears in later Greek and Latin Christian liturgies, it is plausible that the term carried cultural resonances already present in the region — resonances tied, in part, to Amun/Ammon-Ra’s broad cultic reach. Popular memory and ritual vocabulary do not always preserve clean lines of origin; words migrate and accrue meaning in religious contexts, sometimes masking prior associations.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Spiritual Concerns and Demonic Associations</h2>
        <p>From a pastoral and prophetic standpoint, any liturgical element that echoes an idol’s name or cultic invocation should be treated with caution. Many in the Paleo-Messianic and restorationist communities report that verbal echoes of ancient deity-names can function as spiritual footholds for demonic influence, especially when repeated corporately and without critical awareness.</p>

        <p>Because <em>amen</em> so closely resembles <em>Amun/Ammon</em> in sound and was used widely in regions where the Amun cult was powerful, this article argues that continued unreflective use of <em>amen</em> can — at minimum — carry unwanted cultural baggage and, at worst, function as a ritual remembrance of idol worship. Therefore, for those seeking a fully reformed liturgy, it is safer and more honoring to conclude prayers with an explicit benediction that directs glory solely to YHVH.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Liturgical Recommendation</h2>
        <p>We recommend replacing the common ritual closure <em>amen</em> with <strong>Baruch YHVH</strong> ("Blessed is YHVH"), optionally followed by a short, explicit doxology such as "to the One Creator, now and forever." This ensures the congregation's final verbal act is a direct, exclusive blessing of YHVH and leaves no ambiguity or phonetic echo that could be traced to foreign cultic names.</p>

        <p>Suggested local practice for congregations and small groups:</p>
        <p>1) Teach the history and rationale gently; avoid alarmism while presenting evidence and pastoral concern.</p>
        <p>2) Model the practice in public worship: leader concludes prayers with <strong>Baruch YHVH.</strong> Congregation responds with "Shalom" or a brief Scripture verse rather than saying "amen."</p>
        <p>3) Provide written liturgy alternatives for members who are new to the practice.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Scriptural and Theological Support</h2>
        <p>While the Hebrew root <em>aman</em> (to be faithful, to support) exists in the language, linguistic coincidence does not erase the historical reality of cultic influence and syncretism. Scripture commands strict avoidance of foreign gods and names (see <em>Shemot 23:13</em>; <em>Devarim 12</em>). The priority in communal worship should be unambiguous allegiance to YHVH alone. Ending with <strong>Baruch YHVH</strong> reasserts that allegiance.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Pastoral Closing</h2>
        <p>For communities seeking restoration and purity of worship, changing a ritual closure is both a symbolic and practical step. It helps retrain the tongue and heart to reserve praise and recognition solely for YHVH. We encourage leaders to implement this with teaching, prayer, and patience.</p>
