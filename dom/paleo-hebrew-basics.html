    <h2 style="color:wheat;">Paleo-Hebrew Basics: Rediscovering the Ancient Tongue of Scripture</h2>

    <p>
      Paleo-Hebrew is the ancient script used by the people of Israel before the
      Babylonian exile. Unlike the modern square script used in today‚Äôs Hebrew
      Bibles, Paleo-Hebrew was originally pictographic. Each letter carried a
      symbolic meaning, often tied to daily life, agriculture, or spiritual
      truths. Rediscovering this script helps us see Scripture through the eyes
      of the ancients.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">The Nature of the Script</h3>
    <p>
      Each letter in Paleo-Hebrew is more than a sound‚Äîit is an image. For
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aleph (ê§Ä)</strong> ‚Äì shaped like an ox head, symbolizing strength and leadership.</li>
      <li><strong>Bet (ê§Å)</strong> ‚Äì resembling a house, symbolizing family and dwelling.</li>
      <li><strong>Shin (ê§î)</strong> ‚Äì like teeth, representing consuming or devouring.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When read together, these images not only form words but also reinforce
      deeper truths, reminding readers of covenant concepts embedded in daily
      life.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">Scripture in Its Ancient Form</h3>
    <p>
      The oldest Hebrew manuscripts, including inscriptions on pottery, seals,
      and the Dead Sea Scrolls, reveal Paleo-Hebrew as the common script. Torah
      commands like writing the words on doorposts (Devarim 6:9) were first
      fulfilled in this form. By studying Paleo-Hebrew, we return closer to the
      original expression of YHVH‚Äôs Word.
    </p>

    <blockquote style="color:lightgreen; border-left:2px solid wheat; padding-left:10px;">
      ‚ÄúStand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the
      good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls.‚Äù
      (Yirmeyahu 6:16)
    </blockquote>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">Why It Matters Today</h3>
    <p>
      Learning Paleo-Hebrew is not merely academic‚Äîit is restoration. It
      reconnects us to the faith of Avraham, Mosheh, and Dawid. For Messianic
      believers, it deepens prayer, worship, and Scripture study by uncovering
      layers of meaning often hidden in translation. More importantly, it helps
      us reclaim the identity YHVH gave His people.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">Practical Steps to Begin</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with the Paleo-Hebrew alphabeta, learning both sounds and symbols.</li>
      <li>Practice writing verses like the Shema (Devarim 6:4) in Paleo script.</li>
      <li>Use resources that connect Paleo symbols with Torah study and daily devotion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:wheat;">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Rediscovering Paleo-Hebrew is about more than letters‚Äîit is about
      recovering memory. It revives the voice of the prophets and restores the
      covenant context of Scripture. As we walk in these ancient paths, we draw
      closer to YHVH and strengthen our foundation for the days ahead.
